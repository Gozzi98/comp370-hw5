# Task 1: Noise Issues Across the Year

1. Stakeholder's Question:
   - "The mayor wants to know if noise issues tend to stem from different causes across the year."

2. Refinement 1 - More Measurable:
   - "Does the occurrence of noise issues vary throughout the year due to distinct causes?"

3. Refinement 2 - Better Data Mapping:
   - "Can we identify seasonal patterns in noise issues and their underlying causes?"

4. Final Question - Quantifiable and Data-Mappable:
   - "Is there a statistically significant difference in the types and frequencies of noise complaints across different seasons, providing insights into the varying causes of noise issues throughout the year?"

# Task 2: Rat and Mouse Sanitation Issues

1. Stakeholder's Question:
   - "The Departments of Sanitation and Health would like to know where in the city rats and mice are most likely to create sanitation issues."

2. Refinement 1 - More Measurable:
   - "What types of buildings or structures in the city are most susceptible to rat and mouse infestations that lead to sanitation issues?"

3. Refinement 2 - Better Data Mapping:
   - "Can we identify specific property types or structures within the city that are more prone to rat and mouse infestations, resulting in sanitation concerns?"

4. Final Question - Quantifiable and Data-Mappable:
   - "Is there a statistically significant correlation between the characteristics of different types of buildings, structures, or properties in the city and the prevalence of rat and mouse infestations that lead to sanitation issues, providing insights into the most vulnerable areas for targeted intervention?"
